            I can't put into words how thankful I am for you—for walking into my life and filling it with so much light. Thank you for being the reason behind my smiles, for understanding me like no one else can, and for standing by my side no matter what life throws our way.
            You're my blessing from the universe, my proof that miracles do happen. I'll always be grateful for the day I found you, and even more grateful that you stayed.
            Today is all about celebrating you, the beautiful soul that makes every day so much brighter.
            Have the most amazing birthday—you deserve nothing less!🫂❤</p>
